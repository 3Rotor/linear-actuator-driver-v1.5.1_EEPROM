# linear-actuator-driver-v1.5.1_EEPROM
This is for using an Arduino  to control a linear actuator in such a fashion that would enable it to be used on a single axis Solar panel tracking stand, in an effort to make it actively track the sun .  This is actual optical tracking,  not Goto tracking. Come with and Bluetooth android app.

It basically looks at the input of 2 photo-resistors and compares their brightness to know where the sun is,
then flips the voltage applied to the actuator accordingly.
It also has the ability to switch to a time based tracking algorithm, when cloudy. 
the app enables for some manual control, as well as changing tracking telemetry and light level triggers.

It can make coffee too,  but it's a bit heavy on the sugar... Still trying to sort that.  :)
